# Factors that contribute to the success of a Movie

The goal of this project is to identify the factors that contribute to the success of a movie, specifically whether the production company, the movie's budget, or other variables play a significant role in determining a movie's success. By performing a data analysis using Python, this project aims to provide valuable insights that can help movie production companies make more informed decisions about which movies to produce, which companies to partner with, and how to allocate resources to maximize the chances of success.

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022. The dataset includes movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other relevant information. This project involves loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implemented Pearsonâ€™s correlation statistical analysis.

# Skills Learned: 
Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Correlation matrices, Hypothesis Testing, Data Visualization.

# Technology: 
Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

# Data Source:
The dataset is derived from various sources, including IMDb (Internet Movie Database), and it has been preprocessed and consolidated into a structured format for ease of use. It provides a comprehensive set of data points that allow researchers and developers to explore different aspects of movies and perform various analyses. <br/>

# Questions to be Answered:
1. What is the best time of year to release a movie?
2. What is the ideal runtime for a movie?
3. What genre of movie had the most success on average?
4. What genre of movie has the most success overall?

# Summary of Findings: 
Using Python functions the analysis revealed that budget and votes have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.
Also, genres like Action, Adventure, and Comedy are good choices for consistent market success, while Mystery and Animation can be high-reward niches.
